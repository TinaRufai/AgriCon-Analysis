![Dashboard Screenshot](Screenshot%202025-08-11%20120429.png)  

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes survey data from **AgriCon** to understand the major causes of post-harvest crop loss and provide insights for farmer-centered solutions. The findings highlight infrastructure gaps, storage challenges, and technology adoption trends among farmers.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Crop Spoilage:** Spoilage rates reach up to **38%**, with some crops experiencing severe post-harvest losses.  
- **Top Challenges:**  
  - Lack of **dryers** (26 respondents)  
  - Lack of **coldrooms** (30 respondents)  
  - Insufficient **processing plants**, market access, and electricity supply  
- **Storage Situation:**  
  - **54%** of farmers have no storage  
  - **24%** own storage  
  - **22%** rent storage facilities  
- **Technology & Internet Access:**  
  - **70%** have internet access, but many still rely on basic or no technology tools.  

## 📊 Dashboard Features  
- **Spoilage Rate Analysis** by crop type (yam, cassava, tomatoes, maize, others)  
- **Infrastructure Gap Analysis** (dryers, coldrooms, processing plants, electricity)  
- **Storage Medium Distribution** (own, rent, none)  
- **Technology & Internet Access** patterns  
- **Interactive Filters** for farm scale, region, and technology level  

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used  
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, analysis, and dashboard creation  
- **Data Visualization** – Bar charts, pie charts, and interactive slicers  
- **Analytical Skills** – Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations  

## 💡 Recommendations  
1. Invest in cold storage and drying facilities to reduce spoilage.  
2. Expand rural electrification to support post-harvest infrastructure.  
3. Strengthen market access for farmers to reduce delays in crop sales.  
4. Encourage adoption of digital tools for farm and supply chain management.
