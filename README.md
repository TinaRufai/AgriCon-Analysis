# AgriCon-Analysis
AgriCon Survey Insights: Reducing Crop Loss &amp; Driving Farmer-Centered Innovation
Innovation
📊 Project Overview
This analysis explores key factors contributing to post-harvest crop loss among farmers, using survey data from the AgriCon initiative. The goal is to uncover challenges faced by farmers, such as inadequate storage facilities, lack of market access, and limited technology adoption, and to provide insights for targeted interventions.

🔍 Key Insights
High Spoilage Rates

Spoilage rates vary significantly, with the highest reported at 38% for certain crops.

Major Contributing Factors

Lack of Dryers (26 respondents) and Lack of Coldrooms (30 respondents) are key drivers of spoilage.

Additional issues include lack of processing plants, electricity, and market access.

Crop-Specific Loss Trends

Yam, cassava, tomatoes, maize, and other crops show varying vulnerability to spoilage.

Storage Medium Distribution

54% of farmers have no storage, 24% own storage, and 22% rent storage facilities.

Technology & Internet Access

While 70% of farmers have internet access, many still rely on basic or no tech tools.

📈 Dashboard Features
The interactive dashboard provides:

Crop Spoilage Rate Analysis by crop type.

Infrastructure Gaps (dryers, coldrooms, processing plants).

Storage Medium Distribution pie chart.

Technology & Internet Access patterns.

Filters for farm scale, region, and technology usage.

🛠 Tools & Skills Used
Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation.

Data Visualization – Bar charts, pie charts, and interactive slicers.

Data Analysis – Identifying patterns, trends, and correlations.

🎯 Recommendations
Invest in cold storage and drying facilities to reduce spoilage.

Improve rural electrification to support storage infrastructure.

Enhance farmer access to market channels.

Promote adoption of mobile and digital tools for farm management.
